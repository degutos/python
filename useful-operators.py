# Useful operators

# sometimes we need to create a list
mylist = [1,2,3,4]

# We have a special function to create numbers, it is range()

for num in range(10):
    print(num)


# we can also start at different position
for num in range(3,10):
    print('\n ' + str(num))


# we cam also iterate by 2 
print('\b')
for num in range(0,11,2):
    print(num)
