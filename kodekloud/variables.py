# Variables in python

# amount of apples
amount_of_apples = 2
# The cost of an apple in USD
cost_of_apple = 5

print(amount_of_apples * cost_of_apple)

cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple + 2
print(amount_of_apples * cost_of_apple)

# a better way of doing the above
cost_of_apple+=2
print(amount_of_apples * cost_of_apple)
