# Sets
# Sets are an unorder collection of unique elemets 


# Lets create a variable set 
myset = set()

# Lets print out the type of variable set
print(type(myset))

# Adding a new value into a variable of type set
myset.add(1)

# Printing variable myset
print(myset)

# Adding a new value into a variable of type set
myset.add(2)

# printing variable myset
print(myset)

# Adding a new value as repetive number 2
myset.add(2)

# When we print out we notice only one number 2 and not 2 numbers 2
# set is not allowed to record numbers duplicated
print(myset)


mylist = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]

# Printing list mylist as a set, we notice set never duplicates a number
print(set(mylist))
